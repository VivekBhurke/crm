## Getting Started

These instructions will guide you through setting up and running the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
   cd your-repo
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Launches the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Starts the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
For more information, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For more information, see the [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) section.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, allowing full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point, you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
